## Console Tank Game

A simple prototype of a turn based tank shooter game made as a language practice, mainly to use smart pointers and STL.

It's made to be played in the console.

Currently only works on windows. Tested on windows 10 build 17763.737

Uses C++17, so make sure you compiler is not outdated.

Have fun! 😁
